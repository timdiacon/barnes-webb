GENERAL:

☐ at one of the breakpoints the logo disappears from the nav so no way to link back to the homepage. 
Tim: we could squash the space between the navigation links.

RENT:
 ☐ can clicking an image also make it slide please?
   Tim: It should be but I can’t seem to make it work. Might be something to do with the infinite looping? Will have to leave that one with me.
